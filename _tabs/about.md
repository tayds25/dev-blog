#### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tayshaun!

A computer science student at MapÃºa University, Philippines. I'm a full-stack developer leaning towards front-end development and UI/UX. I specialize in web and software development and I love creating design systems and wireframing/prototyping on Figma.

This personal dev blog is meant to be a documentation of my learning journey. I explore front-end development, UI/UX design, linux, programming concepts, and all things technology. Follow me in this journey as I learn all things technology and grow to be a better developer.
